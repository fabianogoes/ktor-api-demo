## Goal
To Learn as develop a Simple REST API using Kotlin with Ktor.

## Technologies

- [Kotlin][0]
- [Ktor][1]
- [Koin][2]
- [Gradle][3]
- [Netty][4]


## Challenges

- Never have any contact with [Ktor][1] before
- To use [Koin][2] to solve Dependency Injection

## Decisions 

- To use [Koin][2] to solve Dependency Injection because it looks well integrated with ktor, and it looks very simple.
- To use layers pattern(Service, Repository, Model) because I think that's very common.
